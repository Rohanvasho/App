# App
In Backend ,I created a file related to fields of an Employee.I am storing the data related to an Employee in a PostgresQl Database. <br />
I tested my Backend using Postman .<br />
I also used several annotations to deal with several incoming request method type. <br />
CORS configuration was allowed to enable cross ports communication between. <br />
In Frontend part,I wrote several components like AddEmployee,Login,Logout,Service and Employee.I used routing to implement Admin login and User login .<br />
In Admin login ,Only Admin is allowed to add  or delete an employee .<br />
In User login,User is only allowed to view the details of all the other employees.<br />
